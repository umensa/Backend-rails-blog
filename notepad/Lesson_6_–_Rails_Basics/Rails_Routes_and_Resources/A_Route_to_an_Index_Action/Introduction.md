# Introduction
It's time to take the training wheels off!
In our Rails Basics course, we created a simple blog app.
And we saw how to set up the model, view, and controller for our Post resource automatically, using a scaffold.
But we also learned that scaffolds don't offer you much control over how your finished resource looks.
So in this course, we're going to create a resource completely from scratch.
We're also going to introduce a concept we haven't looked at thus far: Rails "routes".
Routes are how Rails sends a particular request to the particular controller that can handle it.
