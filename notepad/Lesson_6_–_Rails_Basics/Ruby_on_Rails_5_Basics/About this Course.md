##Creating an App
We'll create a new Rails app, and a simple resource. 
A resource is something you want users to be able to create, read, update, and delete instances of.
With just a couple Rails commands, your site will be ready to run and fully interactive!

##Adding a Model Attribute
Our app is able to store titles for our posts, but we forgot to add a post body to hold the actual post content.
In this stage, we're going to fix that.
First, we need to add a column to the database, so that our post model objects can store the value of their body attributes.
Then we'll need to update our views to let us show those values.
And finally, we'll need to update the controller to allow new body text to be submitted from HTML forms.
