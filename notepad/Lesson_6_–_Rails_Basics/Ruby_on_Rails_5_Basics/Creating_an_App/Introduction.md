##Techer's Notes

**Take These Courses First**
If you're not comfortable with these topics, you should strongly consider taking these courses first:

    Ruby Basics
    Ruby Loops
    Ruby Objects and Classes

Studying is a skill! You'll have an easier time in this course, and the courses that follow it, if you follow a few basic strategies. We've put together some videos to help:

**Installing Rails**
We have three different workshops to help you install a Ruby on Rails 5 development environment on these platforms:

    Mac
    Windows
    Linux

**The MVC Pattern**
One of the conventions Rails follows is a pattern that's widely used in software development, called "Model, View, Controller", or MVC.

    * The models write Ruby objects to the database, and read them out again later.
    * The views show data to users, most often in the form of HTML webpages.
    * Controllers respond to requests from users, usually by coordinating the model and the view.
