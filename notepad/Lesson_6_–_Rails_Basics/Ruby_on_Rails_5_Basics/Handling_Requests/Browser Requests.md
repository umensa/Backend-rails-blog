**Quiz Question 1 of 2**

We access Post resources using the URL `http://localhost:3000/posts`.
The `/posts` portion of the URL specifies which resource on the server we want to access.
What's the term for this part of the URL?

	 In the old days, a resource was just a file in a directory on a web server's hard drive. 
	 And the "path" was the set of directories the server had to traverse to get there. The term is a holdover from that time. 

**Quiz Question 2 of 2**
Please fill in the correct answer in each blank provided below.

Fill in the blank(s) below:

    Suppose we created an app with a Widget resource.
    Complete this URL with the path to access a list of all Widgets.
    (And don't forget, there's a piece of punctuation that separates the path from the host address!)

    http://localhost:3000/widgets
